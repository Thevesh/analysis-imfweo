# Analysis of IMF World Economic Outlook data
My attempts at playing around with IMF WEO data. Full credit to the IMF for the data - available [here](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/SPROLLs/world-economic-outlook-databases#sort=%40imfdate%20descending).

## To-Do
1) Generalise code (more abstraction)
2) Add in layer to read data from `weo-reader` package (does not include Oct 2022 as of `2022-10-13 11:03, GMT+8`)
3) Convert to `.py` script.
